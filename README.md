# CodeLab

The CodeLab for Course and Some Interesting Ideas.

We decided to rewrite the Labs in interesting and famous Computer Science Course in many Universities, such as MIT(6.S081), UCB(CS61A/B/C), Stanford(CS144) and so on.

We wouldn't only translate the Lab Docs, also give detailed examples and some key points in the labs that should be metioned.



## Steps

Here are the steps that may show clearer meanings for this CodeLab:

1. Completely use the resources on the Course Page, such as [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/).
2. Focus on the **Lab Part**, **Lec Part** and **Textbook Part**, just rewrite each Lab as an article which will guide you and give you more details during your time to finish this lab.
3. There'll be two methods here (EASY/DIFFICUIT). The EASY is for some freshman or someone who only want to get knowledge from the Codelab. The DIFFICULT is as same as the translation for the labs itself.



## Framework

The Framework will follow the SurviveXJTU project, and it will be an important part for the Study part in the SurviveXJTU project.
